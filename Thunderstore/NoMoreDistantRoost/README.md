# No More Distant Roost

Because Distant Roost is bad map

"Oh boy!! Distant Roost! Yippee!!!" - said no one ever

## Features
- Rerolls the first stage if it would be Distant Roost
- Works seamlessly in singleplayer and multiplayer without configuration
- Lightweight implementation that leaves the rest of stage selection untouched

## Requirements
- BepInExPack 5.4.2108 or newer
- HookGenPatcher 1.2.3

## Installation
1. Install the latest BepInExPack for Risk of Rain 2.
2. Download the `NoMoreDistantRoost` package.
3. Extract the contents into your Risk of Rain 2 `BepInEx/plugins/` folder, or copy `plugins/NoMoreDistantRoost/NoMoreDistantRoost.dll` there.
4. Launch the game and start a run â€” any first stage other than Distant Roost can now appear.

Or just use a mod manager ^_^

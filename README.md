# No More Distant Roost

No More Distant Roost is a lightweight Risk of Rain 2 mod that guarantees your run always opens somewhere other than Distant Roost. Whenever the base game would spin up `blackbeach` or `blackbeach2`, the mod rerolls the stage selection with an updated list that excludes Distant Roost.

## Features
- Intercepts first-stage picks and rerolls if the game chooses Distant Roost.
- Leaves subsequent stage selection completely untouched.
- Works seamlessly in singleplayer and multiplayer without configuration.

## Support
If you encounter a scenario where Distant Roost still appears as the opening map or have ideas for improvements, lmk ^_^
